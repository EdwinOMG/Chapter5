                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>To use the sticky position, simply apply the <code>position: sticky;</code> property to the desired element. Its position will be relative to the nearest ancestor with a scrolling mechanism.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box relative">

                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>The top and left properties were set to 90 pixels and 30 pixels respectively. This shifted the relative box 90 pixels down and 30 pixels to the right from its initial position.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box fixed">

                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>The top and right properties were set to 90 pixels and 10 pixels respectively. This positioned the fixed box 90 pixels down and 10 pixels from the right edge of the viewport.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box absolute">

                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>The bottom and right properties were set to 0 pixels each. This positioned the absolute box to the bottom-right corner of its containing parent element.</p>
